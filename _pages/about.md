I am a Systems Engineer at Berkadia Commercial Mortgage with a BS in Computer Engineering from the University of Utah. My interests include cloud device management, process automation, and bridging the gap between developers and IT. I have 5 years of experience in IT, starting as a Summer IT Intern and rising through the ranks to become a Systems Engineer. In my current role, I am responsible for all things device management, such as SCCM, Intune (both mobile MDM & workstation MDM), Autopilot, and Jamf managment. I am also responsible for designing and maintaining an Azure Virtual Desktop environment with 600+ users via Terraform.

As for my studies, I graduated from the University of Utah with a BS in Computer Engineering in December 2024. My education has granted me experience in low-level programming (both desktop applications and embedded systems) in languages such as C, as well as high-level programming in Java, C++, C#, Python, and more. Being a Computer Engineer, I also have experience with circuit design.

My hobbies include maker projects (i.e. 3D Printing, etc...), retro console modding, gaming, and hanging out with my wife and two cats Ada and Ralphie.

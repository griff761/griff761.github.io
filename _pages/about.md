I am a Platform Engineer at Berkadia Commercial Mortgage, specializing in cloud infrastructure and automation. My interests include cloud device management, process automation, and bridging the gap between developers and IT. With 5 years of experience in IT, I have grown from a Summer IT Intern to my current role.

In my current role, I focus on enhancing cloud infrastructure and application stability. I've managed container registry migrations from AWS ECR to JFrog Artifactory, migrated on-premise applications to AWS EC2, and implemented CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps to accelerate release cycles. I also develop and improve Terraform modules to provision and manage AWS resources, and I've created AWS SSM automations that have cut EC2 deployment times in half. Previously, I designed and deployed an Azure Virtual Desktop environment using Terraform and re-architected our Jamf Cloud and Microsoft Intune systems to improve device management and security.

I graduated from the University of Utah with a BS in Computer Engineering in December 2024. My education has granted me experience in low-level programming (both desktop applications and embedded systems) in languages such as C, as well as high-level programming in Java, C++, C#, Python, and more. Being a Computer Engineer, I also have experience with circuit design.

My hobbies include maker projects (i.e. 3D Printing, etc...), retro console modding, gaming, and hanging out with my wife and two cats Ada and Ralphie.
